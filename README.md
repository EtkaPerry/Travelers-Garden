# 🌱 Traveler's Garden

*Portable farming for the adventurous soul*

## ✨ About

**Traveler's Garden** brings the magic of portable farming to Minecraft. No longer bound by location or dimension, you can cultivate your crops anywhere your adventures take you—deep underground, in the scorching Nether, or even in the mysterious End.

Simply carry your gardens in your inventory and watch them grow as you explore, though patience is rewarded as portable farming comes with a slower growth rate.
